# Accurate Detection and Prediction of Anxiety and Sleep Apnea using Physiological Signals

The proposed framework utilizes physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), to accurately identify anxiety and sleep apnea events. The framework employs advanced ML/DL techniques to analyze and classify the physiological signals, enabling the prediction of anxiety and sleep apnea events with high accuracy.
